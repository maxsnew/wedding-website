Sam and Max met while they were both undergraduates at Northwestern in
Evanston, IL.

They met during Sam’s junior and Max’s senior year. They met
through mutual friends - Max’s roommates played clarinet in the
Marching Band with Sam.

They began dating in the fall of 2012. The early days were spent
enjoying the Evanston cuisine, cheering on the ‘Cats and spending time
with friends.

Upon leaving Evanston, Max and Sam lived apart for two years while
attending graduate school. Sam went to Philadelphia for her master’s
in genetic counseling while Max went to Boston
for his doctorate in computer science.

They made the trip between the cities over the two years while they
were apart (thanks, JetBlue!) and they were able to maintain and build
their relationship. Upon Sam’s graduation in 2016, she went to Boston
where Sam and Max now live.

They spend their time together cooking, travelling and finding the
best craft beer in New England.
